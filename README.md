## Trading Console

Trading Console is a set of tools written only for my personal use and help in trading and investing activity.

The data is collected from freely available sources/archives on the internet and various dataproviders.
Then the data is converted into actionable information using multiple custom algorithms.And this Information is displayed in a graphical format whereeevr possible.


Using this data requires understanding of equity and Derivatives market fundamentals, and is highly subjective, what works for me wont necessarily work for you. There is no buy or sell signal. The applications sole purpose is to find hidden pattern in market data to spot trends in a timely manner.
